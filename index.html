            India is one of the major players in the agriculture sector worldwide and it is the primary source of
            livelihood for <strong>~55%</strong>of India’s population. India has the world's largest cattle herd
            (buffaloes), the
            largest area planted for wheat, rice, and cotton, and is the <strong>largest producer</strong> of milk,
            pulses, and spices in
            the world. It is the <strong>second-largest producer</strong> of fruit, vegetables, tea, farmed fish,
            cotton, sugarcane,
            wheat, rice, cotton, and sugar. The agriculture sector in India holds the record for <strong>second-largest
                agricultural land</strong> in the world generating employment for about half of the country’s
            population. Thus,
            farmers become an integral part of the sector to provide us with a means of sustenance.

            Consumer spending in India will return to growth in 2021 post the pandemic-led contraction, expanding by as
            much as 6.6%. The Indian food industry is poised for huge growth, increasing its contribution to world food
            trade every year due to its immense potential for value addition, particularly within the food processing
            industry. The Indian food processing industry accounts for <strong>32%</strong> of the country’s total food
            market, one of
            the largest industries in India and is <strong>ranked fifth</strong> in terms of production, consumption,
            export and expected
            growth.

            Foodgrain production in India touched <strong>330.5 million metric tonnes (MT)</strong> in 2022-23 (3rd
            Advance Estimate).
            India is the <strong>world’s 2nd largest producer</strong> of food grains, fruits and vegetables and the 2nd
            largest exporter
            of sugar. A total of 521.27 LMT rice has been anticipated for procurement for the upcoming KMS 2023-24, up
            from 496 LMT produced during the previous KMS 2022-23. <br><br>
